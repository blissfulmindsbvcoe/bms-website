        description: `In order to shine some light on the need to pay attention to mental health, BLISSFUL MINDS SOCIETY organized its very own orientation on 9th March 2022. Through this, we wanted to implant our society's vision of "destigmatizing mental health" among the campus students and spread awareness on how to tackle the much neglected mental health issues. The orientation, which consisted of a self-reflection activity, turned out to be highly successful with a turn-out of 150+ students and over 190 people signing up later to be either a team member or a volunteer.`,
