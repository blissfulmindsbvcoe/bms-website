    detail: `Professionally, I am an Assistant Professor in the ECE Department of BVCOE. During my educational journey from schooling to B.Tech (batch topper), M.Tech (Gold Medalist) and then Ph.D (Remote Sensing), I have always valued myself which I think, is one necessary tip to keep up a balanced mindset.
    
    In every phase of life, we encounter challenges, overcome obstacles, and jump past hurdles before enjoying the victory. What we must not forget is to set realistic goals to stay on track. Realistic goals are attained if and only if we have a healthy mindset. Mental health plays an important role in all of our lives and with the aim to help engineers, my students and I built the Blissful Minds Society. 
    
    Our society aims to educate students on how to take good care of their minds by hosting various stress relieving sessions.
    Few tips that I wish to provide for a healthy mental state are:
    1) Surround yourself with good people.
    2) Silence the chaos in your head by praying or doing relaxing exercises.
    3) Break up the monotony.
    4) Get help when you need, seek help. It is a measure of strength not weakness.

Rooted in my fascination for people and their stories, I have come to realise that the more I strive to make positive changes for people, the more complete I feel. It is okay to not be okay. From playing sports in school to learning how to code (attributed largely to peer pressure in the first year of college), I feel equipped to answer the question of Why Mental Health? I have two compelling convictions. ‚úåÔ∏è`

When time starts resembling the sand slipping through the fingers, remind yourself to take a step back in these overwhelmingly incessant marathon we call life. üåª This collective has been nothing short of an expedition for me. Blissful Minds as an initiative emerged in my mind as a by-product of appalling personal experiences. I hope the awareness of this cause perpetuates in our institution. Leading BMS taught me how to address a crowd, to convince the most difficult of people and that I can pitch and talk passionately about almost anything even in the scorching heat. üíØ`

I couldn't keep up, I wondered how beautiful it would have been if we had a space, a community where we could just slow down, reflect upon our inner selves. So when I was approached for the idea of creating a mental health society it resonated with me to the core because in order to achieve a bright future, unfortunately we are disconnected from our soul. We need a community who accepts everyone with open arms, a community where we can speak our heart out, where we have a lot sessions for self love, self care, inner peace and many more. This is what I invisioned for BMS and I am glad that BMS is going in the right direction with the best team."

But when we look at the positive side this can be good news. We can stop pursuing the mystical, perfect life, we can stop chasing perfect skin, the perfect job, the perfect house, or the perfect partner.
