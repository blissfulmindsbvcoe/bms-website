                <div className='AboutUs__orientation'>The vision of our society is to create a safe space for all, such that under no circumstance, a student feels hesitant to talk about his/her mental health issues. We aim to destigmatize mental illness by conducting interactive and fun sessions, wherein the students can feel heard and can be given useful advice. Through BMS we also intend to give the message that you are not the only one facing issues like peer pressure or social anxiety, and how these are actually mass problems that are often overlooked due to their intangible nature. As we begin our journey to destigmatize mental health, it'll be great to have your support on the way.</div>
